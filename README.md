react-redux-boilerplate
=====================

Great boilerplate for fast creating React/Redux Applications.


### Usage

```
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```

Now edit `src/App.js`.  
Your changes will appear without reloading the browser like in [this video](http://vimeo.com/100010922).

### Using `0.0.0.0` as Host

You may want to change the host in `server.js` and `webpack.config.js` from `localhost` to `0.0.0.0` to allow access from same WiFi network. This is not enabled by default because it is reported to cause problems on Windows. This may also be useful if you're using a VM.
